# Week9

1. I deployed the Dionaea Honeypot.

2. The only issue I encountered when setting up the system was attempting to log in to the admin VM. For some reason, the link on the google cloud sit would timeout when I clicked on it (even though the correct IP was displayed in the browser), but when I typed in the IP manually it worked. Unsure what caused that issue but at least I was able to get around it.

3. I collected mostly pcap "attacks". There were a few other protocols sprinkled in there but it was mostly pcap. Seems to easlily be the most common way to attack the internet as a whole. As of writitng this I had 1834 attacks.

4. I mean I don't really have "unresolved questions" though I'm not sure what you mean by that. I don't know what most of these things mean since all of this is new to me but this is what I expected to see. A bunch of attacks from all over using protocols I've never heard of.
